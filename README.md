# Working-with-Noisy-Data-in-CyberSecurity
As cybersecurity increasingly depends on machine learning and data analytics, cleaning and preprocessing noisy data becomes an essential task. Whether the goal is anomaly detection, building intrusion detection systems (IDS), or threat classification, the quality of your data directly impacts the effectiveness of your security models.

# Cybersecurity Data Preprocessing

This repository contains the code to preprocess noisy and imbalanced cybersecurity data for machine learning applications. Specifically, it handles the UNSW-NB15 dataset, a commonly used dataset for network intrusion detection.

## Contents

- **data_cleaning.py**: Handles missing data, duplicates, and timestamp standardization.
- **feature_engineering.py**: Creates new features and standardizes existing ones.
- **dimensionality_reduction.py**: Reduces data dimensionality using PCA.
- **imbalance_handling.py**: Uses techniques like SMOTE to handle class imbalance.
- **model_training.py**: Trains a machine learning model (XGBoost) on the cleaned and preprocessed data.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cybersecurity-data-preprocessing.git
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the preprocessing steps and model training:
    ```
    python src/data_cleaning.py
    python src/feature_engineering.py
    python src/dimensionality_reduction.py
    python src/imbalance_handling.py
    python src/model_training.py
    ```

4. Alternatively, explore the Jupyter notebook in the `notebooks/` folder:
    ```
    jupyter notebook notebooks/preprocessing.ipynb
    ```

## Dataset

The UNSW-NB15 dataset can be found in the `data/` folder. You can download it from [UNSW-NB15 Data Repository](https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/unsw-nb15-dataset).
